It is also an artificial intelligence (AI) visualization, so you can ask it to find the next dimension to drill down into based on certain criteria. This makes it a valuable tool for ad hoc exploration and conducting root cause analysis.)"

Ribbon charts are effective at showing rank change, with the highest range (value) always displayed on top for each time period. The ribbon chart shows rank for every month. Notice how rank changes across time. For example, the Home category moves from second to fifth from Feb to March.\n",

To use instead of a line chart when you want to change the scale of the horizontal axis. To turn the horizontal axis into a logarithmic scale. To display worksheet data that includes pairs or grouped sets of values.\n",

A KPI visual requires a base measure that evaluates to a value, a target measure or value, and a threshold or goal.\n",
